## Basics

 ![[Probability Summary.png]]

* _[Conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability "Conditional probability")_ is the probability of some event _A_, given the occurrence of some other event _B_. Conditional probability is written as $\displaystyle P(A\mid B)$ 
* Mutually Exclusive events means both events cannot happen together. 
* Independent Events is when $P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B)$  holds for any two events $A$ and $B$.
* BiComparison Function: $\binom{n}{2}$ 
* [Probability limit](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/224959/can-someone-explain-what-plim-is)

## Probability Distributions

Def$^n$ : It is a summary of probabilities for possible values of a random variable.

Three flavours of Random Variables:

a. Discrete Random Variable
b. Continuous Random Variable
c. Boolean Random Variable

The mapping of values of a random variable to a probability has a shape when  the values of the random variables are in sequence. 

Two important properties: Expected value & Variance (aka Moments of Distribution). Two others: Skewness & Kurtosis.

* Expected Value ($\operatorname{E}[X]$ or $\operatorname{E}[f(x)]$) is the mean of the random variable $X$ or $f(x)$ which samples a value from the domain of $X$
* The variance ($V[X]$) is the spread of the values of a random variable from the mean. The  
square root of the variance normalizes the value (of $X$) and is referred to as the standard deviation. The variance between two variables is -- covariance. Covariance shows linear relationship for how two random variables change together.

### Discrete Probability Distributions

// TODO. 

* PMF & CDF
* "Non ordinal -ness" of the values of the random variable.
* $\Sigma$ Probabilities in PMF = 1

Well known Discrete Probability Distributions:

1. Bernoulli & Binomial
2. Multinoulli & Multinomial
3. Poisson 

### Continuous Probability Distributions

// TODO.

* PDF & CDF

Well known Continuous Probability Distributions:

1. Gaussian
2. Exponential
